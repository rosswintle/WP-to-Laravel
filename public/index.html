		Hi developers and designers who use view source and dev tools!

		I thought you might be peeking in here, so let me first say that, yeah, I know the design of
		this thing isn't amazing. I'm not a designer. Visual aesthetic stuff isn't really my bag, so you'll have to just bear with me on that.

		And thanks for looking this thing up. It's a bit of a trial for me putting this together,
		and I hope it's useful for someone.

		I'm flattered that you're hear. Why not drop me a line @magicroundabout and let me know you
		found this.

		Thanks

		Ross

		<h3>A free set of video tutorials that explain Laravel to WordPress developers</h3>
		<p>
			I've had conversations with lots of people about the struggles of using WordPress for things other than publishing and simple content management.</p>
		<p>These days, conversation often turns to the Laravel framework, which I now often use for those things that WordPress isn’t a good fit for.</p>
		<p>I often promise to give people an overview of Laravel if they want one. And to fulfil that promise I’m recording a free set of video tutorials that explain Laravel to WordPress developers.
		</p>
		<h3>Register your interest</h3>
		<p>The videos are being made now. Sign up to be notified when they are ready. I will only use your email address to tell you about this project. You can, of course, unsubscribe at any time.</p>

		<h3>
			Who is this for?	
		</h3>
		<p>
			These videos are intended for people that understand PHP pretty well, and can use a command line/terminal. I probably assume a certain level of general software development knowledge too.

			If you just copy and paste PHP snippets, it’s probably not for you.
		</p>

		<h3>
			What will the videos be about?
		</h3>
		<p>
			The aim is not to teach you Laravel, but to show you around the main parts of it and to try and explain how the core concepts of WordPress map into Laravel concepts.
		</p>
		<p>
			My hope is that you will end up wanting to find out more from the Laravel documentation; from other, better video courses; or from a good book.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am still recording, but the videos are 10 to 30 minutes long and there will be, I think, 10 of them.  The working titles are:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Why Laravel?</li>
				<li><strong>Laravel Concepts</strong></li>
				<li><strong>The Not-So-Famous 5-minute install</strong>: download, install and configure your app</li>
				<li><strong>Where am I and what are all these files?</strong>: an overview of the Laravel file and directory structure</li>
				<li><strong>To do anything, you need a route</strong>: the basics of routing</li>
				<li><strong>Beautiful views</strong>: an quick tour of Laravel’s “Blade” templating system</li>
				<li><strong>Taking control</strong>: an overview of the purpose and structure of controllers</li>
				<li><strong>Data? What data?</strong>: How to define a data structure in Laravel</li>
				<li><strong>I’m a model, you know what I mean?</strong>: A description of the abstract data modelling features of Laravel</li>
				<li><strong>Putting it all together</strong>: Watch me live-code a very basic app from scratch!</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<h3>What will the videos be like?</h3>
		<p>
			Let’s be honest: I’d love to be Jeffrey Way or Wes Bos, but I’m not. So I’ve done my best to make these videos as good as possible, but I’m new to this kind of thing and they won’t be the quality of other screencast tutorials.  That’s partly why they are free.  This is partly an exercise for me in how to do online training.
		</p>
		<p>
			Feedback will be encouraged! I hope you’ll enjoy the course and let me know how you got on.
